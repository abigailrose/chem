# General Info
A selection of scripts to solve simple Chemistry problems. The scripts are written in Ruby due to the inherent support for Ruby in many operating systems, as well as due to the simplicity of the language.

Example scripts include: calculating K values for equilibrium problems, calculating pH of a solution.

Scripts are mainly mathmatical computations.

These scripts are designed to be run natively from the command line. To do this, Ruby needs to be running on your computer.

Windows:
Windows does not have native support for Ruby

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

type ruby *script*.rb in the command line

Mac:
type ruby *script*.rb in the command line
UNIX based systems have native support for Ruby, but

can offer newer versions. Ruby 2.2.4 is the version on my computer at the time of most recent version release. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

(replace *script* with the name of the Ruby script from this repository that you would like to run, i.e. Keq)
